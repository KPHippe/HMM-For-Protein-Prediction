augmentData takes a list of 1 or more seqeunces and uses an HMM to augment the data into a list of n
sequences to unbias the training

Arguements: seqeunces -> list of one or more seqeunces
            n -> the size of the new list to be returned

returns: n -> list of size n the follows the format of data to be fed to HMM
